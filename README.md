# my_browser
It's a browser created in Visual C# using .NetFrameWork
It's a single Tab browser which uses the Trident engine to render webpages.
It has a simple interface 
-URL box
-GO button
-Reload button
-Forward button
I also managed to put in a loading bar which will display the average progress of the pages loaded.
It is capable of playing videos in the web without installing any extension.
